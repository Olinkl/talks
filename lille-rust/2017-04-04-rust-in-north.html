# Rust cool features

Because he has several advantages.
* Security of inputs (via types, no NULL)
* Modern programming syntax (traits, generics, Meta-programming, pattern matching)
* Multi-plateform, close to OS
* Cargo
* Smooth integration with other langages via [FFI](http://jakegoulding.com/rust-ffi-omnibus/) (C, Perl ...)
* Low memory footprints (Borrow Checker) and Zero cost abstraction

---
# Garbage collectors are nice tools.
1. You delegate your memory handling to another sub program.
2. but this sub-program, has to scale as fast as your program.
3. And sometimes it is not, and this program then become a bottleneck,

---
# See

<img src="images/jvmpauses.png" alt="rustacean-knowmore" height="400"/>

I don't say, it doesn't work, but if you don't take the problem from roots.

For some use case, it is just a terrible ~~nightmare~~ idea.

---
# Rust introduce, a way to do it by yourself.
the garbage collection work without significante productivity overhead
through a system called Borrow checker

# Going deeper
## Understanding Ownership and Borrowing

- No GC needed.
- Compiler helps you to not do ~~stupid~~ unsafe things.
- Saving your time

---
# Ownership system
Let me introduce you some peoples
* Rhondup, is a IA spaceship, protector
* Valerien, is a space and time agent
* LaureLine, is a juggler

<img src="images/valerian-laureline.jpg" alt="blender" height="200"/>
* Blender, is an aholic robot

# Ownership : case 1
```rust
Cocktail::new();
```
Rhonda make a new Cocktail

---
# Ownership : case 1
```rust
let valerian = Cocktail::new();
```
Rhonda give ownership of this cocktail to Valerian

Valerian now owns his cocktail

---
# Ownership : case 1
move semantics

```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
let bender_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
```
* Valerian give ownership of a cocktail to Laureline
* Valerian give ownership of a cocktail to Bender
* but Valerian already gave cocktail

---
# Ownership : case 1
move semantics

```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
let bender_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
```
* Valerian give ownership of a cocktail to Laureline
* Valerian give ownership of a cocktail to Bender
* but Valerian already gave cocktail

<span class="wrong">WRONG</span>

---
# Ownership : case 1
```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
let bender_cocktail = laureline_cocktail;
```
* Valerian give ownership of a cocktail to Laureline
* Laureline give ownership of a cocktail to Bender

---
# Ownership : case 1
```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
let bender_cocktail = laureline_cocktail;
```
* Valerian give ownership of a cocktail to Laureline
* Laureline give ownership of a cocktail to Bender

<span class="good">GOOD</span>

---
# Ownership : case 1
```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
let bender_cocktail = valerian_cocktail.clone();
```
* Valerian give ownership of his cocktail to Laureline
* Valerian try to clone his cocktail to give it to Bender

---
# Ownership : case 1
```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
let bender_cocktail = valerian_cocktail.clone();
```
* Valerian give ownership of his cocktail to Laureline
* Valerian ask to Rhonda to clone his cocktail

but already give it to someone else :(
<span class="wrong">WRONG</span>

---
# Ownership : case 1
```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail.clone();
let blender_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
```
* Valerian give ownership of a cocktail clone to Laureline
* Valerian give ownership of his cocktail to Blender

<span class="good">GOOD</span>

---
# Ownership : case 1
same as clone later
```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
drink!("{}", valerian_cocktail);
```

---
# Ownership : case 1
same as clone later
```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
let laureline_cocktail = valerian_cocktail;
drink!("{}", valerian_cocktail);
```

Error, Valerian doesn't own a cocktail anymore !

<span class="wrong">WRONG</span>

---
# Ownership : case 2
nearly same

```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
fruit_shaker(valerian_cocktail);
drink!("{}", valerian_cocktail);
```
* valerian put the cocktail into shaker
* Give ownership of cocktail to the shaker

---
# Ownership : case 2
nearly same

```rust
let valerian_cocktail = Cocktail::new();
fruit_shaker(valerian_cocktail);
drink!("{}", valerian_cocktail);
```
* valerian put the cocktail into shaker
* Give ownership of cocktail to the shaker

<span class="wrong">WRONG</span>
fruit_shaker take ownership of cocktail

---
# Borrowing : case 1
```rust
let mut valerian_cocktail = vec_of_string!["tonic","gin"];
let laureline_cocktail = &valerian_cocktail;
println!("{} {}", valerian_cocktail[0], laureline_cocktail[0]);
laureline_cocktail.push("lemon");
```

<span class="wrong">WRONG</span>
try to modify immutable borrow

---
# Borrowing : case 2
```rust
let mut valerian_cocktail = vec_of_string!["lemon","tonic","gin"];
drink(&mut valerian_cocktail);
drink(&mut valerian_cocktail);
println!("{:}", valerian_cocktail);
```

# Lifetimes

* static
* 'a notation
* lifetime of a child var, could not exceed existing one

---
# Lifetimes ' : case 1

```rust
{
    let a;   // -+ `a comes into scope
             //  |
    let b;   // -+-+ `b comes into scope
             //  | |
             //  | |
             //  * * release
}

```

---
# End of lifetime ..

```rust
impl Drop for Cocktail {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Give glass back!");
    }
}
```

# Design by lifetime

Why lifetimes only for memory allocation ?

# Deeper

Restrictions system
[borrow checker](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_borrowck/borrowck/README.md)

Loan = (Leftvalue, Lifetime, Mutability, Restriction*)

Restriction = (Leftvalue, [Action])

Action = MUTATE | CLAIM | FREEZE


[] (moves)
* MUTATE (cannot be assign)
* CLAIM (cannot be borrowed mutably)
* FREEZE (cannot be borrowed immutably)

&mut LeftValue =>   Restrictions(Leftvalue, Lifetime, MUTATE|CLAIM|FREEZE)

&LeftValue =>       Restrictions(Leftvalue, Lifetime, MUTATE|CLAIM)


---
# Yay

Now you do not need GC !

Dandling socket, and do not care about socket close.

No use after free problem.

See ownership and borrowing is as simple as a free beer.
